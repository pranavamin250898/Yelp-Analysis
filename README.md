## Project Overview

The Yelp Dataset Project is a comprehensive data analysis endeavor aimed at extracting insights from Yelp reviews and ratings data. The project leverages a combination of Big Data tools and techniques to achieve objectives such as identifying positive and negative aspects of businesses, determining common complaints, analyzing customer satisfaction trends, identifying patterns, and comparing sentiment across different businesses.

## Objective

The primary objectives of the project are:

1. **Identify Positive and Negative Aspects:** Utilize sentiment analysis to identify the most positive and negative aspects of businesses based on reviews and star ratings.

2. **Determine Common Complaints:** Analyze reviews and ratings to uncover frequent customer complaints, aiding businesses in addressing issues.

3. **Analyze Customer Satisfaction Over Time:** Track and analyze customer sentiment over time to assess trends and contributing factors.

4. **Identify Trends and Patterns:** Identify and interpret trends and patterns in customer sentiment and preferences.

5. **Compare Sentiment Across Businesses:** Compare sentiment levels among different businesses to pinpoint successful and struggling entities.

## Dataset

The project employs the Yelp dataset, encompassing various aspects of businesses, reviews, ratings, and user information. This dataset serves as the foundation for data analysis, providing insights into customer opinions and feedback.

## Technologies Used

- MongoDB for semi-structured data storage
- Hive for structured data storage
- SSIS for ETL processes
- SQL Server Management Studio for data warehousing
- Tableau for data visualization
- Apache Spark for sentiment analysis using Databricks
- Azure Databricks for Spark processing
